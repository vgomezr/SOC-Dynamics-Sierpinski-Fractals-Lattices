# Self-Organized Criticality Dynamics on Sierpinski Fractal Lattices

## Overview

Welcome to the Self-Organized Critical Dynamics project. This project is dedicated to exploring the Ising-percolation model on Sierpinski fractal lattices. The main goal is to compare the behavior of these fractal lattices with those lacking self-similarity and to comprehend the impact of topology on the emergent properties of critical self-organization.

## Project Objectives

1. **Comparison of Fractal and Non-Fractal Lattices:**
   - Investigate how Sierpinski fractal lattices differ in self-organized critical dynamics compared to lattices with an integer dimension.
   - Understand the impact of topology on emergent properties.

2. **Characterization of Critical Exponents:**
   - Determine distinct exponents characterizing criticality in both Ising and percolation models.
   - Explore how these exponents differ in the context of fractal and non-fractal lattices.
