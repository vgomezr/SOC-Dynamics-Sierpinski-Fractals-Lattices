# Self-Organized Criticality Dynamics on Sierpinski Fractal Lattices

## Overview

Welcome to the Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) Dynamics project, focused on exploring the Ising-percolation models on Sierpinski fractal lattices. The primary objective is to compare the behaviors of these fractal lattices with those lacking self-similarity. Our aim is to understand the influence of topology on the emergent properties of critical self-organization.

## Project Objectives

1. **Comparison of Fractal and Non-Fractal Lattices:**
   - Investigate how Sierpinski fractal lattices differ in critical self-organization dynamics compared to lattices lacking self-similarity.
   - Understand the impact of topology on emergent properties.

2. **Characterization of Critical Exponents:**
   - Determine distinct exponents characterizing self-organized criticality in both Ising and percolation models.
   - Explore how these exponents differ in the context of fractal and non-fractal lattices.
